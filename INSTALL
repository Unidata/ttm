There are two versions of the ttm interpreter.
One is written in C and one is written Java.

-------------
C Interpreter
-------------
The C interpreter is deliberately contained
in a single, self contained C file: ttm.c.
A Makefile exists to create ttm.ex
At the beginning of ttm.c, there are some directives
that control features of the interpreter.
Currently the only directives are as follows:
1. #define HAVE_MEMMOVE - define this if your C compiler/library
   supports the memmove() function, undefine otherwise.

You may also need to change the following lines in the Makefile.
1. CC - to specify the C compiler
2. CCWARN - compile time checks
3. CCDEBUG - to set the optimization and debug levels

Otherwise, compiling is as simple as "${CC} -o ttm ttmc."

Windows Support
---------------
A Windows solutions file is defined in the directory
"Windows". It currently will build and run under Visual
Studio C++ 2010, but the resulting ttm.exe fails when run
standalone. Any help in fixing this would be Appreciated.

-------------
Java Interpreter
-------------
The Java implementation is contained
in the single file src/main/java/ucar/ttm/TTM.java.
An ant build.xml file exists to compile it.
The Java version is noticably slower than the C version.
