<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2
<b>TTM</b> (or <b>ttm</b>)
is a string oriented, general purpose macro processing
developed in 1968 by Steven H. Caine and E. Kent Gordon at the California Institute of Technology.

The following description is taken from the original TTM reference manual[1].
TTM Is a recursive, interpretive language designed primarily
for string manipulation, text editing, macro definition and
expansion, and other applications generally classified as
systems programming. It is derived, primarily, from
GAP [3] and GPM [4].

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
Except where indicated, all flags may be repeated multiple times.
<dl>
<dt><b>-d <i>string</i></b><br>
<dd>
Set a variety of debug options as encoded in the string.
<p><dt><b>-D <i>name=string</i></i></b><br>
<dd>
Predefine the name as a function whose body is the string.
Exactly equivalent to -e #&lt;ds;name;string&gt;.
<p><dt><b>-e <i>string</i></b><br>
<dd>
Scan the string and execute any macro invocations. Any output
left after execution is discarded.
<p><dt><b>-f <i>inputfile</i></b><br>
<dd>
Specify the input file to execute.
Note that this is not the same as the file
specified by the -r flag.
<p><dt><b>-i</i></b><br>
<dd>
After executing any -D and -e options and executing any input file,
enter the read-eval loop to execute commands interactively.
<p><dt><b>-I <i>directory</i></b><br>
<dd>
Append the directory to the include path.
<p><dt><b>-o <i>file</i></b><br>
<dd>
Send all output to the specified file. If not specified, then
output is sent to standard output.
<p><dt><b>-r <i>rsfile</i></b><br>
<dd>
Specify a file from which #&lt;rs&gt; will read its input.
If not specified, stdin is assumed.
Note that this is not the same as the file
specified by the -f flag.
<p><dt><b>-V</b><br>
<dd>
Output the version number of ttm and then exit.
<p><dt><b>-X <i>tag=value</i></b><br>
<dd>
Set a ttm interpreter resource limit.
The tag is a single character indicating what resource
to set, and the value is the value to assign to that resource.
The legal tag characters are as follows:
<table>
<tr><th>Tag<th>Resource<th>Value<th>Description
<tr valign=top><td>b<td>Buffersize<td>integer&gt;0<td>
Set the internal buffer size. The default is 2^20 characters.
The suffix m|M is allowed to indicate multiplying by 2^20.
The suffix k|K is allowed to indicate multiplying by 2^10;
<tr valign=top><td>s<td>Stacksize<td>integer&gt;0<td>
Set the internal stack size. The default provides for a maximum
depth of 64. It is a good idea to keep this number small
so that runaway recursion can be detected quickly.
<tr valign=top><td>x<td>Executions<td>integer&gt;0<td>
Limit the number of executions. The default is 2^16.
The purpose is to catch tail recursive executions that
do not eat up space.
</table>
<p><dt><b>--</i></b><br>
<dd>
Signal the end of options and disable further option
processing. Anythinf after the -- is treated as an argument.
<p><dt><b><i>arg...</i></b><br>
<dd>
Specify arguments that are accessible using the <i>#&lt;argv&gt;</i> function.
</dl>

<h2>OVERALL OPERATION</h2>
The <b>ttm</b> macro processor
scans the input file and executes any macro invocations encountered.
If no file is specified or if file is '-', standard input is read.
Note that in this latter case, all of standard input will be read
up to EOF and then processing will commence.
<p>
It is assumed that TTM is given a text file containing some combination
of ordinary text and TTM function calls (i.e. invocations).
The text is scanned character by character. Any ordinary text is passed
to the output unchanged (except when escaped).
If a TTM function is encountered, it is collected and executed.
<p>
Any arguments after the file name are provided to ttm using the
<i>#&lt;argv;i&gt;</i> function.

<h2>SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS</h2>
The general form of a TTM function call looks like this.
<pre>
#&lt;functionname;arg1;arg2;...;argn&gt;
</pre>
where the functionname and the arguments are arbitrary character strings
not characters of significance: '#', '&lt;', '&gt;', and ';'.
The function is invoked with the specified arguments and the resulting
text is inserted into the original text in place of the function call.
If the function call was prefixed by a single '#' character, then scanning
will resume just <u>before</u> the inserted text from the function call. If the
function call was prefixed by two '#' characters, then scanning
resumes just <u>after</u> the inserted text.
<p>
During the collection of a function call, additional function calls
may be encountered, for example, this.
<pre>
#&lt;functionname;arg1;#&lt;f2;arg;...&gt;;...;argn&gt;
</pre>
The nested function call will be invoked when encountered and the result
inserted into the text of the outer function call and scanning of
the outer function call resumes at the place indicated by the number
of '#' characters preceding the nested call.
<p>
If a function takes, for example, 2 arguments, any extras
are ignored. For user defined functions, if too few arguments
are provided, additional one are added with the value of the empty
string ("").
<p>
As with other applicative programming languages,
a TTM function may be recursive and may be defined as the result
of the invocation of a sequence of other function calls.
<p>
Functions are either <i>built-in</i> or <i>user defined</i>.
A large number of built-in
functions exist and are defined in the TTM reference manual [1].

<h3>Function definition</h3>
User defined functions are created using the following two built-in
functions.
<ul>
<li> #&lt;ds;name;text&gt;
<li> #&lt;ss;name;text1;text2...;textn&gt;
</ul>
<p>
The first function, <i>ds</i> for "define string",
defines a named string in the TTM
dictionary. The name is "name" and its value is "text".
Invoking this named string will cause it's invocation to be replaced
by the value (i.e. "text").
<p>
The second function, <i>ss</i> for "segment string",
scans the text of a previously defined string
looking for occurrences of its arguments: text1, text2, ... textn.
When an occurrence is found, it is replaced with a <i>segment mark</i>.
All occurrences of each argument are replaced by the same segment mark.
<p>
When a segmented string is invoked, each argument to the call
is substituted for the corresponding segment mark.
Consider this example.
<pre>
01 #&lt;ds;F;abcxxdefyy&gt;
02 #&lt;ss;F;xx;yy&gt;
03 #&lt;F;11;22&gt;
</pre>
The string F is defined (line 1) and its body "abcxxdefyy"
is segmented on the two strings "xx" and "yy" (line2).
When invoked (line 3), it will return the value "abc11def22".
In effect, we have a user defined function F with two arguments.

<h3>Escaping</h3>
It is possible to escape one or more characters using either of two
conventions.
<ul>
<li> &lt;...&gt; &ndash; escape multiple characters.
<li> @ &ndash; escape a single character
</ul>
<p>
If a string is enclosed in &lt;...&gt;, then it is scanned 
but not interpreted by TTM. In the scanning process, the outer
&lt; and &gt; brackets are removed. If there are nested occurrences
of &lt;...&gt;, then they are scanned but the '&lt;' and '&gt;' are not removed.
The brackets must balance: the number of '&lt;' characters
must equal the number of '&gt;' characters.

The '@' escape convention causes the interpreter to pass as-is the character
after the '@'. The leading '@' is left if it within a &lt;...&gt;
escape sequence, otherwise it is removed. One use is to
allow unbalanced occurrences of '&lt;' or '&gt;' characters
[Note: in the reference implementation, '@' was changed to '\'].

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Example 1: Function Definition</h3>

The most basic example involves defining
a function that is useful for defining addtional functions.
This "meta" function is called <i>def</i>.
It is written as:
<pre>
#&lt;ds;def;&lt;##&lt;ds;name;&lt;text&gt;&gt;##&lt;ss;name;subs&gt;&gt;&gt;
#&lt;ss;def;name;subs;text&gt;
</pre>
<p>
We can, for example, use <i>def</i> to define the string XX as
12345 and then segment XX on 34 by writing this.
<pre>
#&lt;def;XX;34;12345&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The call
<pre>
#&lt;XX;0000&gt;
</pre>
will then produce the string "1200005".
<p>
The def function operates by invoking ds to define the function
being defined &mdash; XX in our example &mdash; and then segmenting the body
of XX by any specified arguments: "34" in this case. When XX is invoked,
its argument is substituted for the segment mark.

<h3>Example 2: Factorial</h3>
The factorial function can be defined (using the above #&lt;def&gt; function)
as follows.
<pre>
#&lt;def;n!;N;&lt;#&lt;lt;N;2;1;&lt;#&lt;mu;N;#&lt;n!;#&lt;su;N;1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
Notice that the inner computation (#&lt;mu...) is escaped
so it will only be evaluated after the #&lt;lt... function
is executed and returns that nested computation as its result.
<p>
An example call would look like this.
<code>#&lt;n!;3&gt;</code>
and would return the string 6.

<h2>MODIFICATIONS</h2>
This ttm processor adheres closely to the specification in the
ttm specification documents [1,2].
<p>
However, the following general changes to TTM should be noted.
<ol>
<p>
<li> The escape character is changed from '@' to '\'.
<p>
<li> The meta character (end of input) is changed from ''' (i.e. single quote)
to '\n' (i.e. linefeed).
<p>
<li>
Escape handling is slightly different and adheres more closely
to the Unix rules. Specifically, the following escape sequences,
when occurring outside of &lt;...&gt;, are translated as follows.
<table>
<tr><th>Escape Sequence<th>Translation
<tr><td>\r<td>carriage return
<tr><td>\n<td>line feed
<tr><td>\t<td>tab
<tr><td>\b<td>backspace
<tr><td>\f<td>form feed
</table>
Additionally, if an escape occurs at the end of a line,
then that end of line is ignored. This allows one to
provide some formatting for function invocations without
necessarily having to clutter up the result with new lines.
<p>
<li> Only lower case built-in function names are supported.
<p>
<li>
This version of ttm supports (more or less) utf-8. The meta characters
are restricted to be a subset of the US-ASCII 7-bit subset of utf-8.
Otherwise, strings may contain any legal utf-8 multi-byte character.
This allows for inclusion of utf-8 codepoints, but only limited validation
is performed to see if the string is truly utf-8.
<p>
Internally, all characters are represented as 32-bit UTF characters.
This wastes some space, but makes processing simpler.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>A Note on Segment Marks</h3> 
In this implementation, segment (and creation) marks
are represented as a single 32-bit integer, where the value zero
indicates a creation mark and any integer greater than zero
indicates the n'th segment mark.
The integer has bits set so that is is not a legal UTF character.
<p>
One more point about segment marks. It is possible using #&lt;gn&gt;, for
example, to output a string with segment marks in it. The original
documentation is silent on how such segment marks are to be treated.
In this implementation, they are included. If an attempt is made to print
them, they are converted to the form '^n' where n is the segment mark.

<h3>New Functions</h3>
A number of new functions have been implemented and are describe below
using a notation similar to that in [1].
<p>
<b><u>ttm</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>ttm,2,*,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;ttm;cmd;arg1;arg2;...&gt;<br>
This function provides a general mechanism for embedding
special commands to extract or alter interpreter information.
The currently defined commands are as follows.
<table>
<tr><th>Command<th>Description
<tr valign=top><td>#&lt;ttm;meta;metachars&gt;<td>
Change the set of meta-characters.
It takes one argument that specifies the set of
meta characters. Setting the default behavior would use
this invocation: #&lt;ttm;meta; \#\&lt;\;\&gt;\\&gt;.
Note that this is separate from the CM function.
<tr valign=top><!--empty line-->
<tr valign=top><td>#&lt;ttm;info;subcommands;...&gt;<td>
Dump information about internal ttm structures.
The currently defined subcommands for info are as follows.
<table>
<tr><th>SubCommand<th>Description
<tr valign=top><td>#&lt;ttm;info;name;name1;name2...&gt;<td>
Return info about each namei.
<tr valign=top><td>#&lt;ttm;info;class;class1;class2...&gt;<td>
Return info about each classi.
</table>
</table>

<p>
<b><u>include</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b><td>include,1,1,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;include;filename&gt;<br>
Read the contents of the specified file into the buffer and
continue processing.  For security reasons, the constraint
is imposed that the file name must only be accessible
through one of the include paths (i.e. using -I on the
command line).  This has the possibly undesirable
consequence that if the user used #&lt;include&gt;, then the user
must also specify a -I on the command line.  This constraint
also implies that the parameter filename must be a
relative path. If the result from reading the file is unwanted,
then one should use "-e #&lt;include;filename&gt;" on the command line.

<p>
<b><u>argv</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>argv,1,1,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b><td>#&lt;argv;i&gt;<br>
Return the i'th command line argument
starting at 0 (like java, not like C).
The parameter i should be a a non-negative
integer.

<p>
<b><u>classes</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>classes,0,0,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b><td>#&lt;classes&gt;<br>
Return the names of all defined character classes
arranged in sorted order and separated by commas.

<p>
<b><u>pf</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>pf,0,1,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;pf;stderr&gt;<br>
If no arguments are given, then flush stdout and stderr.
If the single argument is the string 'stderr',
then flush stderr.
If the single argument is the string 'stdout'
then flush stdout.

<h3>Modifications to Function Semantics</h3>
The semantics of the following functions others have been changed.
<p>
<b><u>ad</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>ad,2,*,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;ad;num1;...numn&gt;<br>
This function normally takes only two arguments.
It has been extended to take an arbitrary number
of arguments and return the sum of all of the arguments.

<p>
<b><u>mu</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>mu,2,*,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;mu;num1;...numn&gt;<br>
This function normally takes only two arguments.
It has been extended to take an arbitrary number
of arguments and return the product of all of the arguments.

<p>
<b><u>ps</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>ps,1,2,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;ps;string;stderr&gt;<br>
This function normally prints the string on
stdout. If the second argument is the string
"stderr", however, then it prints to stderr.

<p>
<b><u>psr</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>psr,1,1,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;psr;string&gt;<br>
This function prints its argument to stdout
and then reads from stdin up to the meta-character
(see the cm function).

<p>
<b><u>cm</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>cm,1,1,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;cm;string&gt;<br>
This function specifies the character
that is used to terminate input when using,
for example #&lt;rs&gt;.
The default meta-character has been changed
from "'" to "\n". This means that as a rule,
reading will read only a single line of input.
One can, however use the escape character
at the end of the line to read multiple lines
with the escaped '\n' being elided.

<p>
<b><u>cf</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>cf,2,2,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;cf;new-name;old-name&gt;<br>
The original definition said that the body of
old-name, including segment marks and beginning
at the old-name's residual pointer was copied
to the body of new-name.
However, trying to figure out how to handle
a set of segment marks with gaps is problematic.
So, the definition has been modified to
copy the whole body of the old-name
as the body of the new name, ignoring (but duplicating)
the residual pointer.

<p>
<b><u>exit</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>exit,0,1,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;exit;exitcode&gt;</br>
This was changed to allow optional specification
of a return code.

<p>
<b><u>names</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>exit,0,1,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;names&gt;</br>
This was changed so that
if the second argument is present, then
all names are returned, otherwise only non-builtin
names are returned.

<p>
<b><u>tn</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>tn,0,*,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;tn;name1;...namen&gt;</br>
This was changed so that only the specified function names
will be traced. If there are no names provided, then all function
invocations will be traced.

<p>
<b><u>tf</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>tf,0,*,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;tn;name1;...namen&gt;</br>
This was changed so that only the specified function names
will have tracing turned off. If there are no names provided, then no
function invocations will be traced. Note that turning off all tracing
will turn off tracing on all specific function.

<p>
<b><u>ps</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>ps,1,2,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;ps;string;stdxx&gt;</br>
This was changed to an optional allow a second argument that
specifies sending the output to either "stdout"
or "stderr". If missing, then stdout is assumed.
Additionally, in order to avoid spoofing, all control
characters except newline are elided and a final newline is forced.

<p>
<b><u>rs</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>rs,0,0,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;rs&gt;</br>
In order to avoid spoofing, the string 'ttm>' is printed
before reading.

<p>
<b><u>rs</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>rs,0,0,S<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;rs&gt;</br>
In order to avoid spoofing, the string 'ttm>' is printed
before reading.

<p>
The time function from the interactive version differs from
that of the batch version. The interactive time function
corresponds to the batch xtime function and the batch time
function returns time of day instead of execution time.
The batch versions of time and xtime are implemented.
In additon, ctime is implemented to give time of day
in Unix ctime format.
<p>
<b><u>time</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>time,0,0,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;time&gt;</br>
Returns the time of day in 100'ths of second
from ?.
<p>
<b><u>xtime</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>xtime,0,0,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;time&gt;</br>
Returns the execution time in 100'ths of second.
<p>
<b><u>ctime</u></b><br>
<b>Specification: </b>ctime,1,1,V<br>
<b>Invocation: </b>#&lt;ctime;time&gt;</br>
Convert the time (the result of a call to #&lt;time&gt)
to a printable string as defined by the Unix ctime function.

<p>
A number of functions (#&lt;gn&gt;, $&lt;cn&gt;, etc.)
are supposed to return some fixed number of characters.
The original documentation is silent about what should
happen if there are not enough characters available to return.
In this implementation, whatever characters are available are returned,
even if less than the number requested.
